# Fitbit-Data-Analysis
Google Analytics Capstone Project using Fitbit data


This Case Study was completed as part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate.

Objective (Ask Phase)
To analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart
devices

Prepare Phase
The data was downloaded directly from the Kaggle https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit)

Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of
personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes
information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore usersâ€™ habits

Process Phase
After importing the data, the first step was to inspect each attribute for anomalies. Some fields required direct input from the user like for the weight, so no heavy emphasis would be on that information because it could be incorrect

Analyse Phase
In this phase, queries were created to uncover trends that were highlighted in the data visualisations.

Share Phase
Visualisations were created using Tableau. 

Act Phase
A powerpoint presentation was compiled
